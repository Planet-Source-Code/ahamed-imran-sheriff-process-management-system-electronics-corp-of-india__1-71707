To run the application, you will need to install SQL Server Management Studio Express.

You can download this software for free off the internet. Just type the name of the software 
in Google, and click on the first link on the search returns list. The software is available for free download on that website.

You will then need to attach the database files I have provided. If you don't know how this is to be done, please look for a tutorial on the internet. A little bit of googling will help :)

Once you have attached the database, you should find no problems at all in running the application.


Good Luck!!! And Please Vote Friend!!!
